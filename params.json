At night, he leads the development of an open source IoT initiative, the Semantic Repository of Things. Pratik has 8 years of research and design experience in various layers of the IoT and its predecessor technologies such as wireless sensor networks, RFID, and machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. His domains of expertise are the IoT, Semantic Web, machine learning, robotics, and artificial intelligence.\r\n\r\nPratik completed his MS and PhD from Wright State University, Ohio, and collaborated with the Ohio Center of Excellence in Knowledge-enabled Computing (Kno.e.sis) during his doctoral research. His doctoral research was focused on developing situation awareness frameworks for IoT devices, enabling semantic web-based reasoning and handling the uncertainty associated with sensor data.\r\n\r\nIn his personal life, Pratik is an avid DIY junkie and likes to get hands-on experience on upcoming technologies. He extensively expresses his views on technology and shares interesting developments on Twitter (@chheplo).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nFor any questions regarding code or exercises, you can contact me at @chheplo.\r\n","google":"UA-61160290-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
